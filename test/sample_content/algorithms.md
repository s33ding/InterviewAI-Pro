# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Sorting Algorithms

### Quick Sort
- Divide and conquer algorithm
- Average time complexity: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(n²)
- In-place sorting algorithm

### Merge Sort
- Stable sorting algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n log n) in all cases
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Divide and conquer approach

## Search Algorithms

### Binary Search
- Works on sorted arrays
- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Space complexity: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive

### Linear Search
- Simple search algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Works on unsorted data

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed size collection
- Random access: O(1)
- Insertion/deletion: O(n)

### Linked Lists
- Dynamic size
- Sequential access
- Insertion/deletion: O(1) at known position

### Hash Tables
- Key-value pairs
- Average case operations: O(1)
- Worst case: O(n) with poor hash function
