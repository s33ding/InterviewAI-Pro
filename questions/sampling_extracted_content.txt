### Systematic Sampling (Amostra Sistemática)
Key Concepts:
• **Definition**: Method where researcher selects a random starting point, then selects every nth element at regular intervals
• **Process**: For population of 1000 wanting sample of 100, select every 10th individual (1000/100 = 10)
• **Advantages**: Easy to use, ensures uniform distribution across population
• **Disadvantages**: Can introduce bias if there's a regular pattern in population listing that matches sample interval
• **Important Warning**: Should not be used when element order has significance

### Cluster Sampling (Amostragem por Conglomerado)
Key Concepts:
1. Definition: Population divided into groups (clusters), then random sample of groups selected
2. Purpose: Obtain representative sample of total population, especially for large geographic areas
3. Process: 
   • Divide population into clusters
   • Randomly select some clusters
   • Survey all members of selected clusters
4. Advantages: More efficient and economical, especially when individual listing impossible or field travel required
5. Disadvantages: Can introduce more errors than other sampling methods if clusters significantly differ
6. Applications: Market research and social studies for specific populations or geographic areas

### Sample Size Calculation Formulas

For Mean Estimation (μ):
n = (N × σ²) / ((N-1)D + σ²)


For Total Estimation:
Same formula as mean estimation

For Proportion Estimation (q = 1 - p):
n = (N × p × q) / ((N-1)D + pq)


Maximum Error Calculation:
D = B² / 4


Where:
• n = sample size
• N = population size
• σ² = population variance
• D = maximum tolerable error
• p = success proportion
• q = failure proportion (1-p)
• B = desired confidence interval width
